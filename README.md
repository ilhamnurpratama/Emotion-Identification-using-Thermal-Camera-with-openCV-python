# Emotion Identification using Thermal Camera with openCV python

This is an old project for my bachelor thesis, creating a Emotion Identification System using thermal camera with openCV Python.

## How to Use

To run this script you can do following steps :
1. Run "nGUIv.5.py" 
2. Click "New" and fill in the customer identity

Makesure you have connected a thermal camera to your computer and and makesure it is 90 cm from the customer facial area.

Good luck!
